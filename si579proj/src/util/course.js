This course introduces two conceptual models, networks and games, for how information flows and is used in multi-person settings.  Networks or graph representations describe the structure of connections among people and documents.  They permit mathematical analysis and meaningful visualizations that highlight different roles played by different people or documents, as well as features of the collection as a whole.  Game representations describe, in situations of interdependence, the actions available to different people and how each person's outcomes are contingent on the choices of other people.  It permits analysis of stable sets of choices by all the people (equilibrium's).  It also provides a framework for analysis of the likely effects of alternative designs for markets and information elicitation mechanisms, based on their abstract game representations.  Assignments in the course include problem sets exploring the mechanics of the models and essays applying them to current applications in social computing.",

Students will reinforce the practical application of critical thinking; will learn how to apply it to a broader cultural, technological, and social context.  Students will develop their aesthetic sensibilities and design skills through mastering visual language vocabulary, understanding principles of effective visual communication, solving creative problems, and developing analytical thinking, promoting thus their ability to respond professionally to rapidly changing needs of the modern world.  While studying the elements of color, layout and grids, typography, illustrations, and web/digital design, students will build their own portfolio, in the hands-on part of the course, students will explore issues at the intersection of visual information and technology.  They will work on versatile tasks related to digital graphic productions for web:  file formats and images, background textures, collages, UI elements, grid-based website mockups for CSS frameworks.  The tools and features of Adobe Creative Suite will allow students to get the necessary skills, providing them with hands-on experience, and familiarizing them with the standard professional tasks of the always-changing world of digital environment.",

The group may be held together by a common identity, a collective purpose, or merely by the individual utility gained from the interactions.  An online interaction environment is an electronic forum, accessed through computers or other electronic devices, in which community members can conduct some or all of their interactions.  We will use the term eCommunity as shorthand, both for communities that conduct all of their interactions online and for communities that use online interaction to supplement face-to-face interactions.\nThere will be two main treads that weave through the course, based on the two main texts.  One tread will be concerned with the practical issues of design and use of online tools to support communities, and how choices that must be made in design can impact the function and style of the resulting community.  The second thread will focus on the sociological theory that provides a frame to better understand communities in general.  These theoretical pieces will provide a lens for better understanding the implications of choices made on the more practical level.",

For example, a central problem in information science is how to label information stored for later recall. By examining how human memory operates, we can gain some insight into possible schemes that may be compatible with human users.
