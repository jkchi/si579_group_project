Students will develop their aesthetic sensibilities and design skills through mastering visual language vocabulary, understanding principles of effective visual communication, solving creative problems, and developing analytical thinking, promoting thus their ability to respond professionally to rapidly changing needs of the modern world.  While studying the elements of color, layout and grids, typography, illustrations, and web/digital design, students will build their own portfolio, in the hands-on part of the course, students will explore issues at the intersection of visual information and technology.  They will work on versatile tasks related to digital graphic productions for web:  file formats and images, background textures, collages, UI elements, grid-based website mockups for CSS frameworks.  The tools and features of Adobe Creative Suite will allow students to get the necessary skills, providing them with hands-on experience, and familiarizing them with the standard professional tasks of the always-changing world of digital environment.",

The group may be held together by a common identity, a collective purpose, or merely by the individual utility gained from the interactions.  An online interaction environment is an electronic forum, accessed through computers or other electronic devices, in which community members can conduct some or all of their interactions.  We will use the term eCommunity as shorthand, both for communities that conduct all of their interactions online and for communities that use online interaction to supplement face-to-face interactions.\nThere will be two main treads that weave through the course, based on the two main texts.  One tread will be concerned with the practical issues of design and use of online tools to support communities, and how choices that must be made in design can impact the function and style of the resulting community.  The second thread will focus on the sociological theory that provides a frame to better understand communities in general.  These theoretical pieces will provide a lens for better understanding the implications of choices made on the more practical level.",

You will learn how to acquire and process information to act effectively in strategic situations, based on analysis of the motivations of other participants.  You will also learn how to incentivize the motivate users, collaborators and customers to further the objectives of an organization, community or society.",

Data analysis is crucial to evaluating and designing solutions and applications, as well as understanding user's information needs and use.  In many cases the data we need to access is distributed online among many webpages, stored in a database, or available in a large text file.  Often these data (e.g. web server logs) are too large to obtain and/or process manually.  Instead, we need an automated way of gathering the data, parsing it, and summarizing it, before we can do more advanced analysis.  Therefore, students will learn to use Python and its modules to accomplish these tasks in a 'quick and easy' yet useful and repeatable way.  Next, students will learn techniques of exploratory data analysis, using scripting, text parsing, structured query language, regular expressions, graphing, and clustering methods to explore data.  R modules will be used to accomplish these tasks. Students will be able to make sense of and see patterns in otherwise intractable quantities of data.",

      "Course Description": "With the explosive growth of information generated from different sources, in a variety of formats, and with various qualities, information analysis has become challenging for researchers in many disciplines.  Automatic, robust, and intelligent data mining techniques have become essential tools to handle heterogeneous, noisy, nontraditional, and large-scale data sets.  This is a seminar course of advanced topics in data mining, the state-of-the-art methods to analyze different genres of information, and the applications to many real world problems.  The course will highlight the practical applications of data mining instead of the theoretical foundations of machine learning and statistical computing.  The course materials will focus on how the information in different real world problems can be represented as particular genres, or formats of data, and how the basic mining tasks of each genre of data can be accomplished using the state-of-the-art techniques.  To this end, the course is suitable for those who are consumers of data mining techniques in their own disciplines, such as natural language processing, networks science, human computer interaction, economics, social computing, sociology, business intelligence, and biomedical informatics, etc.",
