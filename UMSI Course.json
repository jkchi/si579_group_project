This course provides a hands--on introduction to methods used throughout the entire evaluation process--from identifying the goals of the product, picturing who will use it, engaging users through a variety of formative evaluation techniques, and confirming a product's function through usability testing and summative evaluation.  Specific methods include personas and scenarios, competitive analysis, observation, surveys, interviews, data analysis, heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and task analysis.  Students will work on group projects that apply these techniques to real products in use or development.","Credits":3,"Typical Term Offered":null,"Last Term Offered":"Fall 2022"," 2020-21AY":"Fall \/ Winter","Term Offerings 2021-22AY":"Fall \/ Winter","Tentative Term Offerings 2022-23AY (subject to change)":"Fall \/ Winter","Notes":null,"Cross Listed":null,"Home Department ":null,"Class Assoc Requisite, Enrollment Requirement Grp":"011318-UINF"},{"Subject":"SI","Catalog #":425,"Course Title Long \n(Short)":"Introduction to User Modeling \n(Intro to User Modeling)","Current Enforced Prerequisites":null,"Current Advisory Prerequisites":"STATS 250 or equivalent","Course Description":"This course provides an integrated overview of techniques to model user behavior from economic theory, behavioral economics and computer science.

Thus, even when incentives are \"aligned\" with overall system goals, there are many instances where we make poor choices because as human beings, we are all susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of unwanted and unintended outcomes and decisions.  Our errors are what make us human, but up until now, they have been largely ignored by systems designers, whether these designers make complex public policy, manage a team or design an information system.  But knowing how people think, we can become choice architects who design environments that both yield better decision making on the part of users, and achieve behavior that is consistent with overall system goals while gaining a competitive design-edge.\nThe first goal of this course is to inform future information system professionals, designers and managers about human decision rules and their associated biases so that these insights can be incorporated into their design, business or management strategies.  Knowledge of these issues can be a significant source of competitive advantage because they are unknown to most information systems professionals and they are not taught in most I-schools.  The second goal of this course is to clarify how these results can be leveraged to create original and more effective systems and institutions that meet the designer's goals.\n","Credits":3,"Typical Term Offered":null,"Last Term Offered":"Winter 2022"," 2020-21AY":"Winter","Term Offerings 2021-22AY":"Winter","Tentative Term Offerings 2022-23AY (subject to change)":"Winter","Notes":null,"Cross Listed":null,"Home Department ":null,"Class Assoc Requisite, Enrollment Requirement Grp":"000032-Grad Standing"},{"Subject":"SI","Catalog #":618,"Course Title Long \n(Short)":"Data Manipulation and Analysis \n(Data Man & Analysis)","Current Enforced Prerequisites":"(preceded or accompanied by SI 507 or SI 507 waiver or SI 508) and (SI 544 or SI 544 waiver or BIOSTAT 501 or BIOSTAT 521 or BIOSTAT 601); (C- or better) or Graduate standing in Applied Statistics, Data Science, or Engineering\n","Current Advisory Prerequisites":"SI 504","Course Description":"This course aims to help students get started with their own data harvesting, processing, aggregation, and analysis.  Data analysis is crucial to evaluating and designing solutions and applications, as well as understanding user's information needs and use.  In many cases the data we need to access is distributed online among many webpages, stored in a database, or available in a large text file.  Often these data (e.g. web server logs) are too large to obtain and\/or process manually.  Instead, we need an automated way of gathering the data, parsing it, and summarizing it, before we can do more advanced analysis.  Therefore, students will learn to use Python and its modules to accomplish these tasks in a 'quick and easy' yet useful and repeatable way.  Next, students will learn techniques of exploratory data analysis, using scripting, text parsing, structured query language, regular expressions, graphing, and clustering methods to explore data.  R modules will be used to accomplish these tasks.

The maker movement makes that possible. Makerspaces represent a convergence of rejuvenated interest in do-it-yourself (DIY) practice with technological advances that have democratized access to low-cost, open-source resources. \n Makerspaces (also known as hackerspaces) have their roots in centuries-old practices such as guilds or county fairs. Today's makerspaces are communal or community spaces in which creators of all kinds - known as makers - come together with shared resources to tinker, prototype, swap ideas and expertise, experiment playfully, create, and iterate. Some see the maker movement as a novel approach to manufacturing: lean and nimble, with a rapid, technology-infused pathway from prototyping to manufacture. Others see making as an extension of the human experience, wrapping crafters, coders, artisans, hobbyists, and entrepreneurs under its umbrella, across the novice to expert continuum. Still others see making as a means to survival. Regardless, maker culture is collegial, built on open-source hardware and software and a free and generous sharing of ideas. \n This course explores makerspaces, maker culture, and the open-source, low-cost microcontroller tools (such as Arduino, Lilypad, and Grove) that accelerate maker tinkering. In this course, you are a maker. Through readings, discussion, design charrettes, and hands-on building, you'll construct insights, strategies, and skills to bring your ideas and inventions to life.

Automatic, robust, and intelligent data mining techniques have become essential tools to handle heterogeneous, noisy, nontraditional, and large-scale data sets.  This is a doctoral seminar course of advanced topics in data mining.  The course provides an overview of recent research topics in the field of data mining, the state-of-the-art methods to analyze different genres of information, and the applications to many real world problems.  The course will highlight the practical applications of data mining instead of the theoretical foundations of machine learning and statistical computing.  The course materials will focus on how the information in different real world problems can be represented as particular genres, or formats of data, and how the basic mining tasks of each genre of data can be accomplished using the state-of-the-art techniques.  To this end, the course is not only suitable for doctoral students who are doing research in data mining related fields, but also for those who are consumers of data mining techniques in their own disciplines, such as natural language processing, network science, human computer interaction, economics, social computing, sociology, business intelligence, and biomedical informatics, etc.","Credits":3,"Typical Term Offered":null,"Last Term Offered":"Fall 2022"," 2020-21AY":"Fall","Term Offerings 2021-22AY":"Fall","Tentative Term Offerings 2022-23AY (subject to change)":"Fall","Notes":null,"Cross Listed":null,"Home Department ":null,"Class Assoc Requisite, Enrollment Requirement Grp":"010473 - SI Info Doc"},{"Subject":"SI","Catalog #":724,"Course Title Long \n(Short)":"Qualitative Methods \n(Qualitative Methods)","Current Enforced Prerequisites":null,"Current Advisory Prerequisites":"Doctoral Standing and\/or permission of instructor","Course Description":"The purpose of this seminar is to examine, critique current research employing, and begin to utilize a variety of qualitative methods.

The overall focus of the course will be research design, rather than learning and procedures of a single method.  In addition, we will spend some time trying to think creatively about possible new methods and designs.  Readings in the course will be split between classics and readings concerning very recent innovations in methods.  In discussion of recent methodological trends, particular attention will be paid to internet \/ new media research, new digital sources of data (sometimes called \"big data\" or \"e-social science\"), spatial \/ geographic methods, visualization as a research method, and unobtrusive methods.
